# in-COVID

A one stop app for all services, for all states. That's it.

## Description

This app has been made: 
To extend a helping hand to people suffering in these tough times from COVID-19, directly or indirectly.

To provide details of the availability of hospital beds (govt. and private); details about vendors and suppliers of Oxygen (fresh cylinders and refilling); list of Plasma and blood donors, helpful contacts for food delivery to COVID positive patients under home isolation; contacts for emergency Ambulance services; details and contacts regarding the availability and vendors for Remdesivir and Tocilizumab; and information about ventilators.

This app has been made with the sole purpose of helping and to make matters convenient for users and their families who may be suffering, by providing an organized and well-structured interface within this.

No advertisements. We understand the purpose and mindset of those using our app, hence we wouldn't want them to see unnecessary ads. This app aims to bring an end to social distancing, and promote physical distancing instead. We hope to help as much as we can virtually.

Our aim and yours are the same, we wish to combat and conquer the virus. The fight against COVID-19 is on, but the fight never is or was against humanity.

Hence, we urge the users and the general public to help their fellow citizens as much as they can."
